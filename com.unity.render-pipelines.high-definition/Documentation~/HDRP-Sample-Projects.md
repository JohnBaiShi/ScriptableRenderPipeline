# HDRP Sample Projects

In order to explore more complex usages of the High Definition Render Pipeline, you can have access to several full interactive projects.

These projects are hosted on Unity Technologie's Github. 

Make sure you clone the projects using git or a git client and not using the Green button as this will not download all the assets.
